    "\n",
    "There are ways to having the system to be more evolved with some of teh approaches!\n",

    "What can be done for this is bascially having a such filters for content and being able to use the tags that could really enhance the experience and really connect with the consumer and also having a filter that understand with the consumer interaction with the content and how they would behave. Being about to adjust with the content pending on the behavior of the reader and being able to update the preferences pending on the reader's past history and the interaction. So what they system will be doing for us is that is going to basically recommend topic and the right information to the users and adjust as the system collects more information on the user, enhancing it to make sure it's more engaging with the user. So overall have a system that would recommend content to the reader and enable system to enhance the services for the business and the consumer in return receiving long retentions.\n",
